    FlatDango

Description:
    FlatDango is a movie theater app that displays movies the theater is showcasing at a particular day.
    The movie that shows when a user enters the site is the top trending movie of the season.

    A user should be able to:
        View a list of movies showing
        Click on a movie from a list and:
            See the poster
            See the runtime
            See the showtime
            See the tickets remaining
        Buy a ticket of the movie

Requirements:
    Web Browser

Running:
    Click on a movie title to see the showtime, runtime and available tickets

    You can buy a ticket by clicking the buy button

    A sold out badge will be displayed next to the movies title in the movie list menu when it's sold out and a user can't buy tickets anymore.
